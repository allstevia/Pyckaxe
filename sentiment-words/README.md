### Sentiment Words

All files relating to sentiment words go here. Positive words are words denoting
a positive sentiment, negative words are words denoting a negative sentiment,
and negating words are words that would negate a positively/negatively charged
word.

*Please note: Sentiment analysis is a complex subject - my implementation is
intended to be a very nieve tool, rather than tackle all the complexities that
come with sentiment analysis.*
